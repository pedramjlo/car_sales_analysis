# Introduction
This is my personal data analysis project. I downloaded the dataset from <a href='' >Kaggle</a>. 
this is not an offical real-world project, but solely for the purpose of self-teaching data analysis and practicing my Python skills.


# Techonologies
- Interactive Python Notebook (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas
- Plotly for visualisations


# The Pipeline
The initial raw dataset is opened up and read by DataLoader class, column names and respective values are normalised and cleaned using DataCleaner class. DataExploration handles 
query-writing like exploration within the cleaned data, and finally DataCorrelation class engages with finding out correlation between existing independent variables.
